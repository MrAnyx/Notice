[//]: # (## About Notice)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Needlify is a platform for sharing content and knowledge around IT and new technologies. Initially, this project was a proof of concept, however, as the development progressed, the idea materialized and it would be a shame to abandon the project. Our goal is to be able to offer a platform for sharing knowledge.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Needlify is already available in its original version. This repository aims to refurbish this project with new technologies.)

# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

# Contributing to Notice

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.

If you would like to contribute, take the time to read the project's [wiki pages](https://github.com/MrAnyx/Notice/wiki). They group together all the manipulations to be carried out in the case of pull requests, which formalism to use in commits or issues, ...

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs),
[features requests](#features) and [submitting pull
requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

-  Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests.

-  Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
   respect the opinions of others.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** – check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** – try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` branch in the repository.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant work, otherwise you
risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers
might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (whitespace,
accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

Follow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the
project:

[Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to
license your work under the same license as that used by the project.

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the Wikis with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Accepting patches

1. Check that a patch is within the scope and philosophy of the project.
2. Check that a patch has any necessary tests and a proper, descriptive commit
   message.
3. Test the patch locally.

### Releasing a new version

1. Include all new functional changes in the CHANGELOG.
2. Use a dedicated commit to increment the version.
3. The commit message must be of `v0.0.0` format.

### Semver strategy

[Semver](http://semver.org/) is a widely accepted method for deciding how
version numbers are incremented in a project. Versions are written as
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
